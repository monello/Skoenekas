In this graph you can clearly see which is your dominant DNA Gift and which is your strength Gifts (2nd & 3rd Gifts). Your strongest Gift is from where you get your primary motivation. Your 2nd & 3rd Gifts compliments your unique blend as a person. Your top 3 Gifts determine your DNA (Dynamic Natural Ability). Your focus should be on your primary Gift as your birthright is locked up inside this Gift.  Do not try to increase a low scoring Gift, as these are Gifts and not talents.  Any flat line graph indicates that you have not developed in your primary Gift.  DNA Gifts that show up above the top dotted line means that Gift is very strong. These Gifts and the unique blend that they produce in your life reveals your life purpose.</p>"
